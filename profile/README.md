Welcome to Capital Robotics!

We are Capital Robotics, an enthusiastic and passionate team participating in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC). Our mission is to inspire young minds through science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by building innovative robots and competing in exciting challenges. Founding Year - 2017.

## Awards
- **1st Place Think Award 2024**
- **3rd Place Motivate Award 2024**

## At Capital Robotics, we focus on:

- Improving team
communication
- learning more efficient
programming methods, and innovating in robotics software
- Perform well in competition (and win an award!)
- Managing materials
thoughtfully

We are always looking for ways to grow and improve, whether it’s through collaboration with other teams, gaining support from sponsors, or sharing our knowledge with the broader robotics community. If you’re interested in partnering with us or learning more, feel free to get in touch!


## Our Software Team

The Capital Robotics Software Team is the backbone of our robot’s intelligence and functionality. Our team of skilled programmers works collaboratively to develop the code that powers every movement, decision, and action our robot makes during competitions.

### What We Do

Our software team focuses on several key areas:

- Autonomous Programming: Developing precise and efficient code for the robot to operate independently during the autonomous period, ensuring it can complete tasks like navigating the field and scoring points without driver input.
- Driver-Controlled Programming: Writing responsive and intuitive control systems to allow smooth operation during the driver-controlled period.
- Testing and Debugging: Constantly refining our code through testing and debugging to ensure it’s competition-ready. We work closely with the hardware team to troubleshoot and optimize robot performance.
